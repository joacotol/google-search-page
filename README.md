This project is about recreating a google search page using html, css and chrome dev tool. This is part of the Odin Project curriculum. 

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css)

After finishing this small project as well as the previous one provided by the Odin Project, I can say that I am now comfortable and confident with my HTML and CSS knowledge and skills as well as the use of the basics of chrome dev tools. I hope to apply and continue my practice of perfecting my craft on HTML and CSS as essential skills as a front-end web developer.
